It's accurate to **assert** that *human beings* have been **captivated** by the concept of **death** since the dawn of their very **consciousness** and the **realization** of their own **mortality**.

My **fascination** with the **macabre** began a considerable while back, during my **pubescent** and innocent **childhood**.

At that time, my **sparkling** tiny eyes were profoundly **enamoured** with whatever type of **obscenity** I could possibly lay them upon, being it a **scary** movie, a **war** documentary, non-sensically **violent videogames** (likely culprits of having altogether ruined my perception of art **irreversibly**) and of course, horror in general, which has always *marked* my life in all its *facets*. 

Being it eerie and **gloomy** atmospheres, scenes of **gore**, encounters with **supernatural** beings, demonic possessions, brutal **serial killers** or simply **pure senseless** acts of **unjustified violence**, I found myself drawn to it all. 
And you know what? I'm quite certain I wasn't the only young kid who felt this way.

**Curiosity** in this **particular** regard is often **rewarded** by either **terror** and trauma, or by sheer undeniable **fascination**. 
Some of us were well aware of this. The **thrills** and **spine-tingling** moments were **inevitably** accompanied by a level of **discomfort** and fear that could be quite **challenging** to **endure**, especially for a **child**.

It's **difficult** to remain completely **unfazed** by such *stimuli*. After all, we're **not** psychopaths. **Violence** is frequently **misunderstood** by the general public and regarded as a "**risky**" element to **incorporate** into any form of media, but I can understand **why**.

**Media** is a hugely powerful means of communication other than a **double-edged** sword. As **human** beings, we're easily **influenced** by our **environment**, by the things we **consume**, by the people we interact with. Just *imagine* how **profoundly** can things like **propaganda** and **subliminal** messages disrupt our overall **perception** of reality.

**Research** has shown that **over-exposure** to violent contents can **desensitize** some individuals, decreasing their sensitivity and empathy towards others and cause increased aggressive behaviors, particularly in children and teenagers, but there is still **insufficient** scientific evidence to support a **causal link** between violent media and violent behavior. 

What is safe to say is that individuals with **high** levels of **impulsivity**, heightened **emotional** reactions, and a sense of frustration with that content are definitely more prone to experience a stronger **anger** response when exposed to **media**.

For a considerable period, the **portrayal** of violence has been a matter of **concern** for the general public, and a growing **trend** has emerged where more and more people are becoming **inclined** to criticize and **condemn** violent media content.

We may argue that engaging with violent media can provide an **escape** to the stress of daily life and serve as a means of **catharsis**. 
Through immersing themselves in violent **scenarios** in a **controlled** and **fictional** context, individuals may release **pent-up** emotions and potentially **reduce** real-world aggression. 
Violence can be significant as a mode of **artistic** expression, serving as a potent **tool** to delve into facets of our human/societal **condition** and draw valuable **educational** insights.

Furthermore, it's vital to take into account the potential **effects** on **vulnerable** audiences, especially children, and to recognize the necessity for suitable content **warnings**.
