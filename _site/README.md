# Alcestide.com
Personal website managed with **Jekyll**. Nothing really impressive, but it's my style and I quite like it.

It has a **presentation** page, a **blog** and a **contacts** one. Not entirely *polished* but I've recently finished the very first version and I'm fine with it for now. I'd like to transform it into a proper **portfolio** in due time (which probably means never), a place where I can *showcase* my **projects** and general **skillset**. 

I keep all my main *social links* here, including my e-mail and a bunch of other stuff.

Hosted here on **GitHub Pages** and mapped through CNAME record to https://alcestide.com.
