          <p>It’s accurate to <strong>assert</strong> that <em>human beings</em> have been <strong>captivated</strong> by the concept of <strong>death</strong> since the dawn of their very <strong>consciousness</strong> and the <strong>realization</strong> of their own <strong>mortality</strong>.</p>

<p>My <strong>fascination</strong> with the <strong>macabre</strong> began a considerable while back, during my <strong>pubescent</strong> and innocent <strong>childhood</strong>.</p>

<p>At that time, my <strong>sparkling</strong> tiny eyes were profoundly <strong>enamoured</strong> with whatever type of <strong>obscenity</strong> I could possibly lay them upon, being it a <strong>scary</strong> movie, a <strong>war</strong> documentary, non-sensically <strong>violent videogames</strong> (likely culprits of having altogether ruined my perception of art <strong>irreversibly</strong>) and of course, horror in general, which has always <em>marked</em> my life in all its <em>facets</em>.</p>

<p>Being it eerie and <strong>gloomy</strong> atmospheres, scenes of <strong>gore</strong>, encounters with <strong>supernatural</strong> beings, demonic possessions, brutal <strong>serial killers</strong> or simply <strong>pure senseless</strong> acts of <strong>unjustified violence</strong>, I found myself drawn to it all. 
And you know what? I’m quite certain I wasn’t the only young kid who felt this way.</p>

<p><strong>Curiosity</strong> in this <strong>particular</strong> regard is often <strong>rewarded</strong> by either <strong>terror</strong> and trauma, or by sheer undeniable <strong>fascination</strong>. 
Some of us were well aware of this. The <strong>thrills</strong> and <strong>spine-tingling</strong> moments were <strong>inevitably</strong> accompanied by a level of <strong>discomfort</strong> and fear that could be quite <strong>challenging</strong> to <strong>endure</strong>, especially for a <strong>child</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>difficult</strong> to remain completely <strong>unfazed</strong> by such <em>stimuli</em>. After all, we’re <strong>not</strong> psychopaths. <strong>Violence</strong> is frequently <strong>misunderstood</strong> by the general public and regarded as a “<strong>risky</strong>” element to <strong>incorporate</strong> into any form of media, but I can understand <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Media</strong> is a hugely powerful means of communication other than a <strong>double-edged</strong> sword. As <strong>human</strong> beings, we’re easily <strong>influenced</strong> by our <strong>environment</strong>, by the things we <strong>consume</strong>, by the people we interact with. Just <em>imagine</em> how <strong>profoundly</strong> can things like <strong>propaganda</strong> and <strong>subliminal</strong> messages disrupt our overall <strong>perception</strong> of reality.</p>

<p><br />

<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Research</strong> has shown that <strong>over-exposure</strong> to violent contents can <strong>desensitize</strong> some individuals, decreasing their sensitivity and empathy towards others and cause increased aggressive behaviors, particularly in children and teenagers, but there is still <strong>insufficient</strong> scientific evidence to support a <strong>causal link</strong> between violent media and violent behavior.</p>

<p>What is safe to say is that individuals with <strong>high</strong> levels of <strong>impulsivity</strong>, heightened <strong>emotional</strong> reactions, and a sense of frustration with that content are definitely more prone to experience a stronger <strong>anger</strong> response when exposed to <strong>media</strong>.</p>

<br /><br /></p>

<p>For a considerable period, the <strong>portrayal</strong> of violence has been a matter of <strong>concern</strong> for the general public, and a growing <strong>trend</strong> has emerged where more and more people are becoming <strong>inclined</strong> to criticize and <strong>condemn</strong> violent media content.</p>

<p>We may argue that engaging with violent media can provide an <strong>escape</strong> to the stress of daily life and serve as a means of <strong>catharsis</strong>. 
Through immersing themselves in violent <strong>scenarios</strong> in a <strong>controlled</strong> and <strong>fictional</strong> context, individuals may release <strong>pent-up</strong> emotions and potentially <strong>reduce</strong> real-world aggression. 
Violence can be significant as a mode of <strong>artistic</strong> expression, serving as a potent <strong>tool</strong> to delve into facets of our human/societal <strong>condition</strong> and draw valuable <strong>educational</strong> insights.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it’s vital to take into account the potential <strong>effects</strong> on <strong>vulnerable</strong> audiences, especially children, and to recognize the necessity for suitable content <strong>warnings</strong>.</p>
